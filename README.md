* Add a new SSH key to your GitHub account following below links:
  - [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
  - [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
* Once you are done with setting up SSH key for github create a new repo on your github account. Clone github repo using SSH url.
* Do some changes in repo/file and try to push changes to github repo again. Now it should not ask any credentials while pushing changes to github repo as it should use your SSH key for credentials and authentication now.
